--------------------------
After a period of time (dataReadinessDuration: ISO 8601 duration) alert that a dataset timestamp has not received data. This is useful for detecting SLA misses in a customer's data pipeline finishing and uploading profile data. 


.. code-block:: yaml

   config:
     metric: missingDatapoint
     type: fixed
     upper: 0.0
   dataReadinessDuration: PT60M
   id: missing_datapoint-analyzer
   schedule:
     cadence: daily
     type: fixed
   targetMatrix:
     segments:
     - tags: []
